Welcome to Python BloomFilter's documentation!
==============================================

If you are here, you probably don't need to be reminded
about the nature of a Bloom filter. If you need to learn
more, just visit the `wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter>`_
to learn more. This module implements a Bloom filter in python
that's fast and uses mmap files for better scalability.
Did I mention that it's fast?

Here's a quick example::
    
    from pybloomfilter import BloomFilter

    bf = BloomFilter(10000000, 0.01, 'filter.bloom')

    with open("/usr/share/dict/words") as f:
        for word in f:
            bf.add(word.rstrip())

    print 'apple' in bf
    #outputs True

That wasn't so hard, was it? Now, there are a lot of other things
we can do. For instance, let's say we want to create a similar
filter with just a few pieces of fruit::

    fruitbf = bf.copy_template("fruit.bloom")
    fruitbf.update(("apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"))
    print fruitbf.to_base64()

Why pybloomfilter
-------------------

As I already mentioned, there are a couple reasons to use this
module:

 * It natively uses `mmaped files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap>`_.
 * It is Fast.
 * It natively does the set things you want a Bloom filter to do.
